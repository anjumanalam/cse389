Final Project - Silk City Platters website

Download the files. Files can be downloaded from:
https://github.com/anjumanalam/cse389

Download XAMPP.

Move project folder to htdocs folder in xampp directory.

In order for the files to work, you must first create a Database in phpMyAdmin called scp.
After creating database, create the required tables within that database: tblproducts and users.
In the project folder (scp-website), you can find a folder called database that has scripts that
can be used to create the tblproducts and users table. You can run those in phpMyAdmin to 
easily create the tables.

Ensure XAMPP Apache and MySQL is running. Then, you should be able to open the web pages.
